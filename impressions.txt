Nice, amazing idea with github tipping bot. 

About bountie, I'm a little bit confused with thisL 
1) I must write at the comment "@chaintip fixes #2", but actially issie have number #3 https://github.com/chaintip/bounties/issues/3
2) On which field need to write "@chaintip fixes #2" when I commit new file. There are two filds: title and description. 
I will fill both. 

BTW, add the repo for the chaintip site with source code, then members will be allowe to fix website.
